0. Introduction
================================
This directory contains a set of examples for the FASP package.


================================
1. Build
================================
To compile, you need a Fortran and a C compiler. By default, we use gfortan 
and gcc, respectively; see Makefile for details. 

Now you are ready to make all executables: 

    $ make

which makes all test executables. And, you can use

    $ make clean 

to clean up the directory by removing object files. Or, you can use

    $ make allclean 

to remove the executables also and gives a completely clean directory. 

If you need any extra help, please 

    $ make help

  - data:    Test data
  - ini:     Input files for parameters
