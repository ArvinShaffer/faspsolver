Fast Auxiliary Space Preconditioning (FASP) Solver Package README

Last modified on 09/12/2011 by Chensong Zhang
===================================================

The FASP package is built for developing and testing new efficient (multilevel) 
solvers and preconditioners for discrete partial differential equations (PDEs) 
or systems of PDEs. The main components of the package are standard Krylov 
iterative methods, algebaric multigrid methods, and incomplete factorization 
methods. Based on these standard components, we build efficient solvers for 
several complicated applications, for example: Stokes equation, underground 
water simulation, the (modified) black oil model in reservoir simulation, and 
so on. 

To setup the environment, you need to do two simple steps: 

Step 1. Setup directories for FASP:
     
     [faspsolver]$ ./bin/setup.sh

Step 2. Compile the library: 
     
     [faspsolver/core]$ make

Step 3. Now you can run a few test problems:
     
     [faspsolver/test]$ make

You may want to adjust the "make.inc" for your personal computer environement 
or choose different compiling parameters, etc. For more details, read the README
files in "core" and "test" directories.  

Some simple examples can be found in "tutorial" directory and step-by-step 
instructions are included in the examples therein.
