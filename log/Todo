Goal and important dates
========================

* Release an alpha version by May 31 2012 -- tested extensively inside our group

* Release a stable beta version by the end of 2012

========================
Documentation
========================

[       ] start to make a user’s manual
[ 0.5.5 ] make Doxygen comments more uniform
[ 0.5.7 ] fix missing functions and files in Doxygen
[       ] add more details for Doxygen
[       ] generate reference manual using Doxygen

========================
Structure Changes
========================
	
[ 0.4.1 ] distinguish main branch and developing branch, make hg web server ready for release
[ 0.4.1 ] use INT and REAL for int and double -- allows more flexible data types later
[ 0.4.1 ] define LOGIC type (TRUE and FALSE)
[       ] many functions break down or become obsolete -- remove them!
[       ] some constants are used in several functions -- define them in a header file

========================
AMG	
========================

[ 0.1.1 ] compare with hypre
[ 0.1.1 ] compare with SAMG
[       ] compare with AGMG

[ 0.3.9 ] separate SA and UA code
[ 0.5.0 ] profile and optimize a few core functions: RS, EM
[       ] profile and optimize a few core functions: SA, UA

[       ] aggressive coarsening, long distance interpolation for classical AMG
[       ] non-overlapping/overlapping schwarz smoother, polynomial smoother
[       ] estimation of extreme eigenvalues 
[       ] add preconditioners for Stokes
[       ] add preconditioners for Maxwell

========================
Iterative Methods
========================

[       ] options to replace the standard BLAS and SpBLAS functions
[       ] make sparse operations cOMPatible with the SpBLAS
[       ] test SpBLAS implementations in standard libraries
[       ] right preconditioners 

[       ] unify different data format: CSR, BSR, block CSR, STR, etc
[       ] different options for stopping criteria: rel res, abs res, etc
[       ] solve several problems simultaneously Ax=b --> AX=B

========================
Test Suite
========================

[ 0.4.1 ] start to build the debug environment
[       ] finish the debug environment
[ 0.6.0 ] build upon regression.c to make a regression test suite
[       ] add a new unit test tool for FASP, like CHECK
	
========================
Test Examples
========================

[ 0.6.0 ] modularize the Poisson equation code -- get rid of Xuehai's P1-FEM code
[ 0.6.4 ] optimize refine code and assembling code -- get rid of realloc from the loops

[ 0.6.0 ] add Zhiyang's 5pt 7pt FDM code for Poisson
[ 0.6.4 ] add Heat equation as a test example
[       ] add the Stokes test problem 
[       ] add the Maxwell test problem 

[ 0.4.1 ] build a new “tutorial” directory with a few simple examples
[       ] add a set of examples in “tutorial” and do user’s manual accordingly

========================
OpenMP version
========================

[ 0.4.1 ] OMP functions should be separated from the sequential ones
[       ] OMP functions and serial functions use same interface -- preprocessing
[       ] make a uniform OpenMP version
[       ] add black-red ordering to OMP version
[       ] profile and optimize OMP code

========================
GPU version
========================

[ 0.3.4 ] AMG based on aggregation
[       ] GMG on GPU
[       ] sparse basic linear algebra subroutines
[       ] testing some routines using OpenACC

========================
Bug Fixes
========================
	
[ 0.4.1 ] fix a critical bug in BiCGstab: 9X9 diagonal matrix (one DoF, eight bdy) gives NaN
[       ] fix iteration count bug in BiCGstab
