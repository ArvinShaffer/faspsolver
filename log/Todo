Test and Debug
========================

[ 0.4.1 ] start to build the debug environment
[       ] finish the debug environment
[ 0.6.0 ] build upon regression.c to make a regression test suite
[       ] add a new unit test tool for FASP, e.g. CHECK
	
========================
Test Examples
========================

[ 0.6.0 ] add Zhiyang's 5pt 7pt FDM code for Poisson
[ 0.6.0 ] modularize the Poisson equation code -- get rid of Xuehai's P1-FEM code

[       ] add a set of examples in “tutorial” and do user’s manual accordingly

========================
OpenMP Support
========================

[ 0.4.1 ] OMP functions should be separated from the sequential ones
[       ] OMP functions and serial functions use same interface -- preprocessing
[       ] make a uniform OpenMP version
[       ] add black-red smoothing to OMP version
[       ] profile and optimize OMP code

Bug Fixes
========================
	
[ 0.4.1 ] fix a bug in BiCGstab: 9X9 diagonal matrix (one DoF, eight bdy) gives NaN
[       ] fix an iteration counting bug in BiCGstab
[       ] check other iterative solvers for similar bugs
