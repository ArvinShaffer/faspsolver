-- Test Problems and Regression Test Suite

================================
0. Introduction
================================
This directory contains a set of problems for regression tests and tools for 
developing the FASP package.


================================
1. Build
================================
To compile, you need a Fortran and a C compiler. By default, we use gfortan 
and gcc, respectively; see Makefile for details. 

Now you are ready to make library and the test problem(s) by 

    $ make
or
    $ make testall

You can use

    $ make clean 

to clean up the directory by removing object files. Or, you can use

    $ make allclean 

to remove the executables also and gives a completely clean directory. 

There are other test problems included in this directory. To see more details, try 

    $ make help


================================
2. Test
================================
By running the executable test.ex, we can get numerical results for different test 
examples. The terminal command to invoke the test problems is

    $ ./test.ex

which tests a bunch of solvers at a single call. 


================================
3. Input
================================
And test.ex reads parameters from ini/input.dat, where you can choose:

* solver type:   1  CG method
                 2  BiCGstab method
                 3  MinRes method
                 4  GMRes method
                 5  Variable restarting GMRes method
                 6  Variable restarting FGMRes method
                 7  GCG method
                 21 AMG as solver
                 22 FMG as solver
                 31 SuperLU (external)
                 32 UMFPACK (external)

* precond type:  0  No preconditioners
                 1  Diagonal preconditioner
                 2  AMG preconditioner
                 3  ILU preconditioner (external)

* solver parameters (which we do not discuss here, see details in the documentation 
  	 	     contained in doc directory).

  - coarsening type ( 1--3 )
  - interpolation type ( 1--3 ) 
  - max_row_sum ( 0, 1 )
  - strong_threshold ( 0, 1 )
  - truncation_threshold ( 0, 1 )

Note: This is not a complete list of available parameters. For more details, please 
refer to the user documentation.
