================================
0. Introduction
================================
The FASP package is designed for developing and testing new efficient solvers 
and preconditioners for discrete partial differential equations (PDEs) or 
systems of PDEs. The main components of the package are standard Krylov methods, 
algebaric multigrid methods, and incomplete factorization methods. Based on 
these standard techniques, we build efficient solvers, based on the framework 
of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning, for several complicated applications. 
Current examples include the fluid dynamics, underground water simulation, 
the black oil model in reservoir simulation, and so on.

================================
1. Tree Structure
================================
    - src:     source codes
    - doc:     user documentation in HTML and TeX
    - include: header files
    - lib:     libraries 
    - extra:   external files optional for FASP


================================
2. Compiler
================================
To compile, you need a Fortran and a C compiler. By default, we use gfortan 
and gcc, respectively; see Makefile for details. 

This package has been tested with: 

--Linux and Mac
    C/C++:   gcc-4.2, gcc-4.4, gcc-4.5, gcc-4.6, icc-11.x; 
    Fortran: gfortran-4.4, gfortran-4.5, gfortran-4.6, g95-0.92, ifort-11.x.

--Windows XP and Windows Vista
    C/C++:   VC++ 2005, VC++ 2008, icc-11.1.x, icc-12.0.x;
    Fortran: ifort-11.1.x, ifort-12.0.x. 


================================
3. Build
================================
You can make the header file using (You can skip this step as the headers files 
have already been generated for you initially): 

    $ make headers

Now you are ready to make the FASP library file: 

    $ make lib

or just:

    $ make

To clean up the working directory, you may

    $ make clean 

which cleans up the directory by removing object files ONLY; To obtain a completely
clean directory (removing all the executables also), you need to do

    $ make allclean 

If you need any help, you can type:

    $ make help


================================
4. Test Problems
================================
Now you are ready to use the library. If you need to see some test problems, go to 
the "../test" directory for test problems and read the README file therein as well. 
If you wish to see some practical problems where FASP has been applied, see 
"../fasp4*" directories. Each of these directories contains a particular application.

Please be noted that the codes containing in some of the "../fasp4*" directories 
might be proprietary (not freely available to general public).
