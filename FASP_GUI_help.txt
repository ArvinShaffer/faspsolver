Configuring and building the FASP library and test suite requires
CMake 2.8 or higher, found at http://www.cmake.org/ 

This installation script calls cmake  for configuration and
building of the FASP library, tutorial and test programs. 

Button "Config": Deletes the build directory if it exists and then
       		 	 makes initial configuration.

Button "Install": Installs the library in "base/lib" and test and
       		  	tutorial executables in the "test/" and
       		  	"tutorial/" subdirectories respectively.

Button "HTML docs": Generates html files with documentation in
       	     	    	       "doc/htdocs"

Button "Headers": If you change/add a function name in a C source
       	     	           file, then pressing this button will
       	     	           generate the header file with the updated
       	     	           function definitions.

Button "Uninstall": Removes all the components installed with
       		            "Install" and also removes the build
       		            directory
